  description: >
    [Make Your Choice](https://github.com/laewliet/make-your-choice) allows you to
    select your DBD matchmaking region **without a VPN**. It works by blocking all
    other regions using your `hosts` file. This approach is **safe** since it does
    not touch the DBD game files.
